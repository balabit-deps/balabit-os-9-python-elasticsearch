Description: Python client for Elasticsearch (Python3 version)
 Official low-level client for Elasticsearch. Its goal is to provide common
 ground for all Elasticsearch-related code in Python; because of this it tries
 to be opinion-free and very extendable.
 .
 The client's features include:
  * translating basic Python data types to and from json (datetimes are not
    decoded for performance reasons)
  * configurable automatic discovery of cluster nodes
  * persistent connections
  * load balancing (with pluggable selection strategy) across all available
    nodes
  * failed connection penalization (time based - failed connections won't be
    retried until a timeout is reached)
  * thread safety
  * pluggable architecture
 .
 This package contains the Python 3 version of the library.
